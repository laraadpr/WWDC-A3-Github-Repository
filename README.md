# WWDC-A3-Github-Repository
Student ID: 24427597

To view my final source code for my Working With Data and Code A3 project, please click the "WWDC A3 Final Project (2442597)" file and then the document named "FinalProject 2442597.pde". Here you should see 54 lines of code.

If you want to view the final image this code generates, download the Processing application using the link: https://processing.org/ 

By copying the source code into the application and pressing the “run” button, you should be able to view the final product.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my project 
